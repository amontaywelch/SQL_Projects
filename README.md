# SQL_Projects
Welcome to the Python section of my data analysis portfolio! In this repo you will find projects that showcase the statistical analysis and reporting skills that I have picked up since starting my SQL journey mid 2023. These are part of my personal projects collection, which are designated to show my technical abilities over anything. I have a repository that houses personal Python projects [which can be viewed here.](https://github.com/amontaywelch/Python_Analyses)
